# Game Basics and Functionality

TLDR: Watchers send Dares at their own expense/risk using NERV and Player chooses to do it or not, They receive the NERV nonetheless.

note: these are not the final plans for the game.

## Watcher

### Watching Players
Watchers must have NERV in their Nerve wallet to watch a player.  
This is verified by checking the watcher's wallet balance.

### Sending Dares
Any watcher can send any Player with Dares, But the dare must be funded with NERV.  
If a watcher sends a Dare the player can do it instantly in their livestream,  
When a watcher sends a Dare there is no guarantee that the Player will do it so send Dares at your own risk or at Top Players.  

* Note: We plan to release a rating system based on the Dares done by the Player.
* Note: Watchers can only send a Dare if a Player is active/livestreaming.
* Note: Balance must be above 0 NERV to watch players.

## Player
Any player can accept dares sent by Watchers.  
A player can receive Dares anytime they are active/livestreaming

### How do players accept dares?
Players can receive Dares instantly if they are live streaming with their account.  
The limit of dares in a player's account is fixed to 10 Dares.

#### Finishing a Dare
* Players can only mark a Dare as finished if the Watcher sends the 'Dare Complete' Signal (This will be rephrased in the future.)
* Watchers have 24 hours to send the 'Dare Complete' signal else it will be marked as finished after that time frame.

### Livestreaming/Active
Players need to livestream to become active thus receive new Dares in their account.  
Livestreams will be checked every 1 minute if they are active.
